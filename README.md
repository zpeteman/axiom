# Axiom

Axiom is a command-line tool that brings the beauty of generative art and fractals to your terminal. Our goal is to create a simple, lightweight, and fun tool for exploring the world of digital art.

## Philosophy

We believe that art should be accessible to everyone, and that the command line can be a powerful and creative canvas. Axiom is designed to be a tool for exploration and play, and we encourage you to experiment with its features and see what you can create.

## Installation

We are working on making Axiom available as a package for Linux and Windows. In the meantime, you can build it from source by following the instructions in our [usage guide](USAGE.md).

## Contributing

We are always looking for new ideas and contributions. If you would like to contribute, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, we welcome your contributions.
